				<h2> Beatriz Fusaro Guimaraes </h2>
				<p> I am a student at Georgia Tech pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on automation and robotics and a minor in Computer Science. Creating new products is my true passion, and I don't spend a day without a project to work on. The machine shop is my second home, but I also love coding and design. If there is a new concept that needs development, you can count on me!</p>

				<h2> Kevin Choi </h2>
				<p> Kevin is a 3rd-year undergraduate student majoring in Mechanical Engineering. As a student with a deep interest in robotics and autonomous systems, Kevin has worked with the Battlebots team as well as the research team for agricultural robotics. As a result of working with these teams, he has gathered experience in structural design and multidisciplinary collaboration- for example, creating an elegant solution for the drum weapon for Battlebots that reduces the number of modes of failure as well as collaborating with teams specializing in electrical, mechanical, and optical properties to create a robotic gripper that encompasses all of these characteristics. Through the competition, Kevin seeks to learn new skills as well as apply the skills he has accumulated through his career.</p>

                <p> I am a third year computer science student who is passionate about all things music.  I am deeply interested in the intersection between software engineering and music creation.  I’ve given a TEDx talk discussing music complexity, especially in modern pop music, and how sound design can be used creatively to elicit emotions of the listeners.  Simply put, I’m a huge music geek, audiophile, etc.  In addition to my academic endeavors and music tech projects, I am 1/2 of the hip-hop duo SOLANTA, which I rap and produce for.
